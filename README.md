<h1>2D Java Animation</h1>
<p>
This is a basic 2D animation project developed in core Java using Swing and AWT libraries. It features simple animation logic such as object rendering, movement, and frame updates using timers or loops. The source code is organized under the <code>src/</code> folder with all relevant <code>.java</code> files, while compiled <code>.class</code> files are excluded via <code>.gitignore</code>. To run the project, compile the Java files and execute the <code>Main</code> class. This project is ideal for learning Java graphics and animation fundamentals.
